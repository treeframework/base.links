# links

The `links` module is a high level module which styles global links.

## Dependencies

The `links` module depends on one other module:

* [settings.defaults](https://github.com/treeframework/settings.defaults)

If you install the `links` module using Bower or npm, you will get these 
dependencies at the same time. If not using Bower or npm, please be sure to 
install and `@import` these dependencies in the relevant way.

## Installation

You can install the `sprite` module via Bower, npm, or copy and paste.

### Install using Bower:

```sh
$ bower install tree-links --save
```

Once installed, `@import` into your project in its Base layer:

```scss
@import "bower_components/tree-links/base.links";
```

### Install using npm:

```sh
$ npm install tree-links --save
```

### Install via file download

The least recommended option for installation is to simply download
`_base.links.scss` into your project and `@import` it into your project in
its Base layer.
